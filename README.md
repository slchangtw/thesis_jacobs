# Fruit classification and detection using deep convolutional models

This study aimed to recognize and dectect the images in [Fruit 360](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits) (The one released on  16.01.2019 was used).
The goals of this research are hence twofolds: 
(1) to develop a fruit image classifier using the single-fruit images; and
(2) to build a fruit image detector using the multi-fruit images. 
To carry outthe classification task, 10 CNN-based classification models were proposed. Moreover, this study introduced *SHapley Additive exPlanations* 
to explain the model predictions. To build the detector, a CNN-based detection algorithm *you only look once* was employed in light of its accuracy and speed in previous work. 
Resultsof this study showed that the best-performing classification model achieved 99.64% accuracy and 99.63% F1 score on the test dataset.
